Water Quality Control and Flood Detection is a system which produces a continuous report about the water quality of the natural resources and gives an overhead of flood alert. The system will predict the water level using the previous data that is stored in the systemâ€™s database. End User is classified mainly into three different categories namely, the public, pharmaceutical companies, and the Government Agencies.
The sensors are installed in the different water bodies which gives us real time data of the composition of minerals in the water bodies and they are stored in the database

This system was developed using Ruby on Rails-MVC architecture, as part of CS440-Software Engineering 1, by a team of 3 students. 
Venkata Devi Niharika Sakuru,Sneha Komandur Parthasarathy are my teammates. Together, we developed it.
